Cybersecurity ‚Äì Day 1 Notes (Basics & Fundamentals)

This repository contains structured notes from Day 1 of my Cybersecurity learning journey. The goal is to build a strong foundational understanding of security principles before progressing into advanced areas such as SOC analysis, cloud security, and threat intelligence.

These notes are carefully written to serve as:

A knowledge base for my personal growth.

A reference document for anyone beginning Cybersecurity.

A living repository that will expand with each day of study.

üìñ Topics Covered in Day 1
1. Introduction to Cybersecurity

Definition and significance in the digital era.

Role of cybersecurity in safeguarding data, systems, and critical infrastructure.

Real-world relevance: financial systems, healthcare, defense, and enterprise IT.

2. Security Principles ‚Äì CIA Triad

Confidentiality: Ensuring data access is restricted to authorized users.

Integrity: Protecting information from unauthorized modification.

Availability: Ensuring systems and services remain accessible.

3. Extended Security Goals

Authenticity: Verifying data origin and user identity.

Accountability: Tracking user actions and system activity.

Non-Repudiation: Preventing denial of actions performed.

Privacy: Safeguarding personal and sensitive information.

4. Types of Hackers

White Hat: Ethical professionals who strengthen systems.

Black Hat: Malicious attackers exploiting vulnerabilities.

Grey Hat: Operate between ethical and unethical boundaries.

Script Kiddies: Amateur attackers using pre-made tools.

Hacktivists: Attackers with political or social motives.

State-Sponsored Hackers: Nation-backed advanced threat actors (APTs).

5. Security Team Structures

Red Team: Offensive experts simulating real-world attacks.

Blue Team: Defensive professionals monitoring and responding.

Purple Team: Collaboration of Red & Blue teams for balanced improvement.

White Team: Oversees engagements and ensures fairness.

Yellow Team: Focused on software and code security.

Green Team: Blends development (yellow) and defense (blue).

6. Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks

Threats: Potential harmful actions (malware, phishing, insider threats).

Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses in systems or processes.

Risks: Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability with impact.

Examples: Weak passwords (vulnerability), brute-force attack (threat), account compromise (risk).

7. Risk Management & Assessment

Identification: Detecting possible risks.

Evaluation: Analyzing likelihood and impact.

Mitigation: Applying security controls.

Monitoring: Continuous reassessment and improvement.

Frameworks: NIST RMF, ISO 27005.

8. Security Terminologies

Exploit, Patch, Zero-Day, Incident, Breach, Firewall, IDS/IPS ‚Äì defined and categorized.

9. IT Security vs Cybersecurity

IT Security: Protects physical devices, IT infrastructure, and organizational assets.

Cybersecurity: Broader focus on digital, cloud, and online threats.

10. OWASP Top 10 (2021) ‚Äì Web Application Risks

Broken Access Control

Cryptographic Failures

Injection

Insecure Design

Security Misconfiguration

Vulnerable & Outdated Components

Identification & Authentication Failures

Software & Data Integrity Failures

Security Logging & Monitoring Failures

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

üéØ Objective

The objective of these notes is to create a progressive cybersecurity knowledge base that will cover:

Fundamentals and principles.

Network security and monitoring.

Cloud and IAM security.

Threat intelligence and red team operations.

Risk management and compliance.

This Day 1 document is the first milestone in a long-term learning roadmap that will extend until advanced cybersecurity specializations.

üìå Repository Guidelines

Notes will be added day by day in Markdown format.

Each file will represent a learning module or daily study outcome.

All notes will be concise, professional, and interview-relevant.
